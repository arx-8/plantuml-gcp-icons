* About

This is heavily inspired in the [[https://github.com/milo-minderbinder/AWS-PlantUML][PlantUML AWS library]].

* How to use

Clone/download a copy of this repo and then make sure to include
~common.puml~ first, then all the icons you might need.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml
  @startuml
  !include ./GCP Icons/Products & Services/Storage & Databases/Cloud Bigtable.puml
  !include ./GCP Icons/Products & Services/Big Data/BigQuery.puml

  GCP_CloudBigtable(foo, "My BigTable")
  GCP_BigQuery(bar, "Data Processing")

  foo -> bar

  @enduml
#+END_SRC

You can also directly use the files from this git repo, you just need
to remember to replace all spaces with ~%20~.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml
  @startuml
  !define GCPBase https://gitlab.com/rolando.a/plantuml-gcp-icons/raw/master/GCP%20Icons/Products%20&%20Services

  !includeurl "GCPBase/Storage%20&%20Databases/Cloud%20Bigtable.puml"
  !includeurl "GCPBase/Big%20Data/BigQuery.puml"

  GCP_CloudBigtable(foo, "Big Table")
  GCP_BigQuery(bar, "Data Processing")

  foo -> bar
  @enduml
#+END_SRC
